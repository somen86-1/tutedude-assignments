Assignments of Tutedude Python Course

**Module 2: Basic Python Concepts**

**Task 1** - Takes two numbers as input from the user and performs basic mathematical operations on these two numbers i.e. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, and displays the results of each operation on the screen at the end.

**Task 2** - Take the user's first and last name as input, concatenate them, and print a personalized greeting message using the full name.


**Module 3: Control Structures in Python**

**Task 1** - Check if a Number is Even or Odd - Take an integer input from the user. Check whether the number is even or odd using an 'if-else' statement and display the result.

**Task 2** - Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop - This program uses a 'for' loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50, calculates the sum of all integers in this range, and displays the final result.


**Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python**

**Task 1** - Calculate Factorial Using a Function - Write a Python program that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion and returns the calculated factorial.

**Task 2** - Using the Math Module for Calculations - Write a Python program that asks the user for a number as input and uses the math module to calculate square root, natural logarithm (log base e) and sine of the number (in radians).


**Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python**

**Task 1** - Read a File and Handle Errors - Write a Python program that opens and reads a text file named sample.txt, prints its content line by line and handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

**Task 2** - Write and Append Data to a File - Write a Python program that takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt. Also appends additional data to the same file and reads and displays the final content of the file.


**Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python**

**Task 1** - Create a Dictionary of Student Marks - Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values. Asks the user to input a student's name and display their corresponding marks. If the student's name is not found, display an appropriate message.

**Task 2** - Demonstrate List Slicing - Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Extracts the first five elements from the list and reverse it. Print both the extracted list and the reversed list.
